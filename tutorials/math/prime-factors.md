## Overview

A prime factor is a factor of a number that is also a prime number. For example, the prime factors of $12$ are $2$ and $3$, as $12 = 2 * 2 * 3$. Prime factorization is the process of finding the prime factors of a number. This can be done by repeatedly dividing the number by prime numbers until the remaining number is also a prime number. The prime factorization of a number is unique, meaning that there is only one combination of prime numbers that multiply together to equal that number. The prime factorization of a number can be useful in solving mathematical problems such as finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers or the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers.
